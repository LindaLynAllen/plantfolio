# Supabase Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Supabase for your Plantfolio application, from creating a project to configuring your local environment.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- The Plantfolio project cloned and dependencies installed

---

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. **Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)**

2. **Click "New Project"**

3. **Fill in project details:**
   - **Name:** `plantfolio` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password:** Generate a strong password and **save it securely**
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your location for best performance
   - **Pricing Plan:** Free tier is perfect for this project

4. **Click "Create new project"**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for provisioning

---

## Step 2: Run Database Migration

Once your project is ready:

1. **Open the SQL Editor:**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"New query"**

2. **Copy the migration file:**
   - Open `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` from your project
   - Copy the **entire contents**

3. **Paste and run:**
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`)
   - You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

4. **Verify tables were created:**
   - Click **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - You should see 4 tables: `plants`, `photos`, `tokens`, `sync_logs`

### What This Migration Does:

‚úÖ Creates all database tables with proper types and constraints  
‚úÖ Sets up indexes for query performance  
‚úÖ Configures Row Level Security (RLS) policies  
‚úÖ Adds a placeholder token row (you'll update this later)  
‚úÖ Enforces single-row constraint on tokens table

---

## Step 3: Create Storage Bucket

Your plant photos need a home in Supabase Storage:

1. **Open Storage:**
   - Click **"Storage"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"Create a new bucket"**

2. **Configure bucket:**
   - **Name:** `plant-photos`
   - **Public bucket:** ‚úÖ **Yes** (checked)
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

3. **Verify bucket is public:**
   - Click on the `plant-photos` bucket
   - Confirm **"Public bucket"** label is visible at the top

### Why Public?

Your plant photos are meant to be displayed on your public website. Making the bucket public allows direct access to image URLs without authentication.

---

## Step 4: Get Your API Credentials

Now let's grab the credentials you'll need for your `.env.local` file:

1. **Open Project Settings:**
   - Click **"Settings"** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
   - Click **"API"**

2. **Copy your Project URL:**
   - Find **"Project URL"** section
   - Copy the URL (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Save this** - you'll need it for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`

3. **Copy your anon (public) key:**
   - Scroll to **"Project API keys"** section
   - Find the **"anon public"** key
   - Click **"Copy"**
   - **Save this** - you'll need it for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

4. **Copy your service_role key:**
   - In the same **"Project API keys"** section
   - Find the **"service_role"** key
   - Click **"Reveal"**, then **"Copy"**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This key has admin privileges - keep it secret!
   - **Save this** - you'll need it for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

---

## Step 5: Configure Local Environment

Now let's set up your environment variables:

1. **Create `.env.local` file:**

   ```bash
   # In your project root
   touch .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your Supabase credentials:**

   Open `.env.local` and paste:

   ```bash
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

   # Cron Job Security
   CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-here

   # Node Environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Replace the placeholders:**
   - Replace `https://xxxxx.supabase.co` with your **Project URL**
   - Replace `your-anon-key-here` with your **anon public key**
   - Replace `your-service-role-key-here` with your **service_role key**

4. **Generate CRON_SECRET:**

   ```bash
   # Run this in your terminal to generate a secure random string:
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Copy the output and use it for `CRON_SECRET`

5. **Save the file** and verify it's in `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   cat .gitignore | grep ".env"
   # Should show: .env*
   ```

---

## Step 6: Verify Connection

Let's test that everything is working:

1. **Run the connection test:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:connection
   ```

2. **Expected output:**

   ```
   üîç Testing Supabase connection...

   Test 1: Connection & Credentials
   ‚úÖ Connected to Supabase successfully!

   Test 2: Database Tables
   ‚úÖ plants      : Exists
   ‚úÖ photos      : Exists
   ‚úÖ tokens      : Exists
   ‚úÖ sync_logs   : Exists

   Test 3: Public Data Access
   ‚úÖ Plants: Public read access working (empty table)
   ‚úÖ Photos: Public read access working (empty table)

   üéâ Supabase connection test passed!
   ‚úÖ Your database is ready for development!
   ```

3. **If you see errors:**
   - Double-check your `.env.local` values
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the keys
   - Verify the migration ran successfully in Supabase
   - Check that variable names match exactly (including `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

---

## Step 7: Verify Security (Optional)

Want to double-check your security configuration? Here's what to look for:

### RLS (Row Level Security) Status

In Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Click on each table
3. Look for the **"RLS enabled"** indicator

**Expected configuration:**

- **plants:** RLS enabled, 1 policy (public read)
- **photos:** RLS enabled, 1 policy (public read)
- **tokens:** RLS enabled, 0 policies (no public access)
- **sync_logs:** RLS enabled, 0 policies (no public access)

### What This Means:

‚úÖ Public visitors can view plants and photos (your website)  
‚úÖ Only your API routes can access tokens and sync logs (secure)  
‚úÖ No one can write to the database via public client (protected)

---

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your Supabase backend is now fully configured:

- ‚úÖ Database tables created with proper schema
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security policies configured
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket ready for photos
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured locally
- ‚úÖ Connection verified and working

---

## Next Steps

Now that your database is ready, you can:

1. **Add test data** (optional) - See `supabase/README.md` for SQL examples
2. **Start building the home page** - Display your plant gallery
3. **Run the dev server** - `npm run dev`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection test fails with "Missing environment variables"

- Verify `.env.local` exists in project root (not in a subdirectory)
- Check that variable names are spelled correctly
- Make sure there are no quotes around the values
- Restart your terminal/editor after creating `.env.local`

### "Table does not exist" errors

- The migration didn't run successfully
- Go back to Step 2 and run the SQL migration again
- Check for any error messages in the SQL Editor

### "Cannot read plants/photos" errors

- RLS policies might not be set up correctly
- Re-run the migration (it's safe to run multiple times)
- Check the **Authentication ‚Üí Policies** section in Supabase dashboard

### Storage bucket not found

- Verify bucket name is exactly `plant-photos` (with hyphen)
- Check that it's set to **Public** in the Storage section
- You may need to create it manually via the dashboard
